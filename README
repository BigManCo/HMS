1. Server Installation
  == REQUIREMENTS ==

  1. A web server that can handle HTTP range requests. Apache and lighttpd are 
     two examples.

  == Port 80 ==

  Currently most of the Roku player's APIs work with alternate ports. But not all 
  of them. So it is best if you can run the server on port 80. Under Linux the
  easiest way to do this is to just connect port 80 to port 8888 of the server by
  adding this to your /etc/sysconfig/iptables (or similar) file:

  *nat
  -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.101.4 --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8888
  COMMIT

  Replace the IP with the IP of the server it is running on. It will direct all 
  port 80 traffic to port 8888.

  == Configuration ==

  (NOTE: Not all of this has been implemented at this time)

  The client software will display directories from the webserver, so make sure
  that a directory is returned when the url is visited.

  The client software displays the directories on the server, allowing you 
  to organize your content into categories however you wish.

  They type of playback for a directory is controlled by an empty file inside
  the directory named:

  movies    A list of movies to play
  episodes  Episode selector for the files in the directory
  songs     Play the songs using the song player
  photos    Show the images as a slideshow

  If there is no file it will only display directories.

  In all cases where a directory or movie are displayed if there is a file
  with the same name but ending in .jpg or .png it will be used as the image
  for the icon or cover.

  If a directory contains the file 'episodes' the client will use the name of the
  parent directory as the name of the Show and season. Video in the directory
  will be shown using the episode selector.

  Videos should be valid files supported by the Roku (mp4, wmv, mov, m4v)
  If there is a file ending in .txt that will be used for the details page.

  If the filename has -SD or -HD it will be played as a SD or HD video
