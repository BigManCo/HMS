1. Server Installation
  == REQUIREMENTS ==

  1. A web server that can handle HTTP range requests. Apache and lighttpd are 
     two examples.

  == Port 80 ==

  Currently most of the Roku player's APIs work with alternate ports. But not all 
  of them. So it is best if you can run the server on port 80. Under Linux the
  easiest way to do this is to just connect port 80 to port 8888 of the server by
  adding this to your /etc/sysconfig/iptables (or similar) file:

  *nat
  -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.101.4 --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8888
  COMMIT

  Replace the IP with the IP of the server it is running on. It will direct all 
  port 80 traffic to port 8888.

  == Configuration ==

  The client software will display directories from the webserver, so make sure
  that a directory is returned when the url is visited.

  Directory names will be used as the name of the category, with _ (underscore)
  replaced with a space. 

  If there is a file with the same name ending in .jpg or .png that will be used
  for the icon of that directory.

  If a directory contains the file 'episodes' the client will use the name of the
  parent directory as the name of the Show and season. Video in the directory
  will be shown using the episode selector.

  Videos should be valid files supported by the Roku (add list here)
  If there is the same filename with .jpg or .png extension that will be used for
  the cover shot for the video.
  If there is a file ending in .txt that will be used for the details page.

  If the filename has _SD or _HD it will be played as a SD or HD video
  If the filename has _dddd it will be used as the kbps value

  If the directory is full of .jpg images it will be displayed as a photo album
  If the directory is full of .mp3 files then they will be played
