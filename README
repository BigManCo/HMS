1. Server Installation
  == REQUIREMENTS ==

  a. Python
  b. virtualenv
  c. pip
  d. libcurl-devel
  e. libjpeg-devel
  f. zlib-devel
  g. libmp4v2
  h. "Development Tools"

  On a rpm based system this should work to install all the requirements:
  yum groupinstall "development tools"
  yum install libcurl-devel libjpeg-devel zlib-devel libmp4v2 python-setuptools \
        python-virtualenv python-pip python-imaging

  == virtualenv setup ==
  Setup the virtual python environment:
      pip -E pyvirt install -r hms/tornado.pip 
      . ./pyvirt/bin/activate
      cd hms
      ./hms.py

  == Port 80 ==

  Currently most of the Roku player's APIs work with alternate ports. But not all 
  of them. So it is best if you can run the server on port 80. Under Linux the
  easiest way to do this is to just connect port 80 to port 8888 of the server by
  adding this to your /etc/sysconfig/iptables (or similar) file:

  *nat
  -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.101.4 --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8888
  COMMIT

  Replace the IP with the IP of the server it is running on. It will direct all 
  port 80 traffic to port 8888.

  == Configuration ==
  The first thing to do is add the directories where your media files are 
  stored. Log into the system and select 'Media Sources'. Give it a name and
  a local path (only local directory is supported at this time).
  Click 'Add Source'

  Delete links currently don't prompt before deleting, be careful.

  Click on 'Import New Media' and it will scan the directory for supported
  media files. For movies it will run mp4info on it to get the details of
  the video format.
