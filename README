  == Configuration ==
  The first thing to do is add the directories where your media files are 
  stored. Log into the system and select 'Media Sources'. Give it a name and
  a local path (only local directory is supported at this time).
  Click 'Add Source'

  Delete and Edit currently don't work

  Click on 'Import New Media' and it will scan the directory for supported
  media files. For movies it will run mp4info on it to get the details of
  the video format.
