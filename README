1. Server Installation
  == REQUIREMENTS ==

  a. Python
  b. virtualenv
  c. pip
  d. libcurl-devel
  e. libjpeg-devel
  f. zlib-devel
  g. libmp4v2
  h. "Development Tools"

  On a rpm based system this should work to install all the requirements:
  yum groupinstall "development tools"
  yum install libcurl-devel libjpeg-devel zlib-devel libmp4v2 python-setuptools
  easy_install virtualenv pip

  == virtualenv setup ==
  Setup the virtual python environment:
      pip -E pyvirt install -r hms/tornado.pip 
      pip -E install pil
      . ./pyvirt/bin/activate
      cd hms
      ./hms.py

  == Configuration ==
  The first thing to do is add the directories where your media files are 
  stored. Log into the system and select 'Media Sources'. Give it a name and
  a local path (only local directory is supported at this time).
  Click 'Add Source'

  Delete links currently don't prompt before deleting, be careful.

  Click on 'Import New Media' and it will scan the directory for supported
  media files. For movies it will run mp4info on it to get the details of
  the video format.
